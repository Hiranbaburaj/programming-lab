<strong>Client-Server Model<br></strong>
</h2><p>
The client-server model, or client-server architecture, is a distributed application framework dividing tasks between servers and clients, which either reside in the same system or communicate through a computer network or the Internet. The client relies on sending a request to another program in order to access a service made available by a server. The server runs one or more programs that share resources with and distribute work among clients.<br></div>

The client server relationship communicates in a request–response messaging pattern and must adhere to a common communications protocol, which formally defines the rules, language, and dialog patterns to be used. Client-server communication typically adheres to the TCP/IP protocol suite.<br>

TCP protocol maintains a connection until the client and server have completed the message exchange. TCP protocol determines the best way to distribute application data into packets that networks can deliver, transfers packets to and receives packets from the network, and manages flow control and retransmission of dropped or garbled packets. IP is a connectionless protocol in which each packet traveling through the Internet is an independent unit of data unrelated to any other data units.<br>

Client requests are organized and prioritized in a scheduling system, which helps servers cope in the instance of receiving requests from many distinct clients in a short space of time. The client-server approach enables any general-purpose computer to expand its capabilities by utilizing the shared resources of other hosts. Popular client-server applications include email, the World Wide Web, and network printing.<br><br>

Components of web-based applications<br></strong>
</h2>

<p>

<strong>Domain Name System</strong><br>

Domain Name System (DNS) bridges the communication gap between computers and humans and makes the machine-user interaction a lot easier. It’s a fundamental system that resolves domain names to IP addresses. So if you type in a web address in your web browser, DNS will transform the name to a number. In this way, a particular server gets a request transmitted by a user.<br><br>

<strong>Network Load Balancer</strong><br>

Imagine you need to develop a website to scale to serve millions of users, all of whom are accessing it simultaneously. In this case, you need a hardware device called a load balancer that intercepts all the users’ requests and directs them to one of the multiple services. Commonly, servers process users’ requests similarly, so the load balancer spreads the tasks between various services to prevent overloading.<br><br>

<strong>Web App Servers</strong><br>

A web server processes static web content such as HTML pages, images, videos in response to users’ requests and transmits documents back to a web browser. To execute this task, it turns to back-end infrastructures (database, cache server, etc.).<br><br>

<strong>Databases</strong><br>

Databases provide instruments to structure, add, search, upgrade, delete, and run computations. Commonly, web app servers directly communicate with the job servers.<br><br>

<strong>Caching Service</strong><br>

Caching service submits a repository for data, which enables storing and searching information. Anytime users receive data from the server, obtained results come to cache. So, future requests get back quicker. Simply put, caching makes it possible to refer to the previous outcomes to speed up the computation process.<br><br>

<strong>Services</strong><br>

When a web app gets to a specific level, services are made in the form of separate applications. They are not that recognizable among other web app elements, but web applications and other services deal with them.<br><br>

<strong>CDN</strong><br>

Content Delivery System (CDN) controls sending HTML files, CSS files, JavaScript files, and images. It’s a distributed system network that delivers digital content to the end server globally, allowing users to load different sources.<br><br>

<strong>Data Warehouse</strong><br>

All applications deal with data gathering, storing, and analyzing. This process goes through the following stages:<br><br>

    1.The data is delivered to the data “fire station”, which submits a streaming interface for information absorption and processing.<br>
    2.Raw, structured, and unstructured data is transmitted to the cloud storage.<br>
    3.And structured and additional data is also sent to the data warehouse.<br>

The data warehouse is used for keeping an incredible amount of files of different types.<br>

<strong>
Types of Websites<br></strong>
</h2>
<p>
1) E-Commerce Websites<br>

    A website for e-commerce is a website from which individuals can purchase products directly. You’ve likely previously used a number of e-commerce sites; most large brands and many smaller ones have one. Any website with a shopping cart, including a manner to provide data about credit cards for purchases, falls under this category.<br>
    This website is the kind you must create if you are building a website for your enterprises and intend to sell your goods through the website. Some measures must be taken to guarantee that your clients are safe to pay for their eCommerce site, such as investing in eCommerce software and receiving your SSL certificate. Ecommerce websites can be an expansion of a company or something around which you are building a fresh company.<br><br>

2) Business Websites<br>

    A website for a company is a website dedicated to a particular company. They should be branded as the company and communicate the goods and/or services that the company provides. Every prospective client you meet will simply suppose that they will find a website if they are looking for your company at Google. And it makes the company less professional or legitimate if they don’t.
    The website for e-commerce is business websites, but it is also possible to have company websites that do not directly sell anything but rather encourage visitors to contact us for further information or to go to a store if they are looking for customers.<br><br>

3) Portfolio Websites<br>

    Websites on portfolios are sites that show examples of previous work. A website can be used by service suppliers wishing to demonstrate to prospective customers the quality of their work to obtain some of the finest examples of previous work.<br>
    This sort of website is easier to create than a company website and focuses more on a specific job: gathering job samples. This website has been most commonly employed by creative experts and freelancers based on proven expertise and can be a more effective solution to a business-like website.<br><br>

4) Media Websites<br>

    News stories or other reporting are collected on media websites. Some overlap here with entertainment websites, although media websites may include reported material concerning or only for entertainment purposes. Sites such as The Washington Post, Slate, and Inc. are included in this category.<br>
    Media websites usually create cash by way of advertising, subscription models, or a mixture of both. There are many media sites online that are often the media branch of media properties, such as TV stations or newspapers, but some are only online. But there are also media properties.<br><br>

5) Nonprofit Website<br>

    Just as companies need websites to be online, so do non-profit companies. Many prospective donors can create donations by using a non-profit web page, and many individuals want to know more about a non-profit and see if they want to assist it.<br>
    In order to show your legitimacy and reach more persons, constructing your company web site is or is considering starting a non-profit. You can use it to promote your organization’s initiatives, encourage supporters to take action and accept donations.<br><br>

6) Educational Websites<br>

    In the category of academic websites, websites of academic organizations and those provide online courses to students and the person who wants to study. The main aim of these websites is to provide visitors with educational materials or to provide them with information on a learning institution.<br>
    Some instructional websites have publicity, such as entertainment and media websites. Some offer models of subscription or purchasing education products. And for a current organization, some serve as the internet presence.<br><br>

7) Infopreneur Website<br>

    Websites from Infopreneur overlap slightly with websites from businesses and e-commerce but are a single form of online business. Creating and selling data products by infopreneurs. This can be classes, tutorials, videos or ebooks. Infopreneurs need to work hard to build an awareness brand to convince tourists that they understand enough to create their instructional goods worth purchasing and to sell those goods.<br>
    In order to safely sell data goods, some of the same website tools, including an SSL certificate and a commercial account, are required. For those with a wide variety of information products, e-commerce software should also make it simpler to pick and buy those who are concerned. An infopreneur website is a key place for both the free content that is a marketing tool to get individuals on the site and paid products that consider their earnings.<br>
