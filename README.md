2. Check whether the given number is odd or even
3. Swap two variables
4. Count the occurrences of each word in a line of text.
5. Find the factorial of a given number
6. Display future leap years from current year to a final year entered by user.
7. Enter 2 lists of integers. Check (a) Whether list are of same length (b) whether list sums
to same value (c) whether any value occur in both
8. List comprehensions:
(a) Generate positive list of numbers from a given list of integers
(b) Square of N numbers
(c) Form a list of vowels selected from a given word
(d) List ordinal value of each element of a word (Hint: use ord() to get ordinal values)
9. Create a string from given string where first and last characters exchanged. [eg: python -> nythop]
10. Prompt the user for a list of integers. For all values greater than 100, store ‘over’ instead.
11. Store a list of first names. Count the occurrences of ‘a’ within the list
12. Get a string from an input string where all occurrences of first character replaced with
‘$’, except first character.
[eg: onion -> oni$n]
13. Exchange first and last characters of a string
14. Find biggest of 3 numbers entered.
15. Accept a file name from user and print extension of that.
16. Create a list of colors from comma-separated color names entered by user. Display
 first and last colors.
17. Accept an integer n and compute n+nn+nnn.
18. Print out all colors from color-list1 not contained in color-list2.
19. Create a single string separated with space from two strings by swapping the
 character at position 1.
20. From a list of integers, create a list removing even numbers. 
21. Find gcd of 2 numbers.
22. Sort dictionary in ascending and descending order.
23. Merge two dictionaries.

Course Outcome 2 (CO2)
1. Program to find the factorial of a number
2. Generate Fibonacci series of N terms
3. Find the sum of all items in a list
4. Generate a list of four digit numbers in a given range with all their digits even and the
 number is a perfect square.
5. Display the given pyramid with step number accepted from user.
Eg: N=4
1
2 4
3 6 9
4 8 12 16
6. Count the number of characters (character frequency) in a string.
7. Add ‘ing’ at the end of a given string. If it already ends with ‘ing’, then add ‘ly’
8. Accept a list of words and return length of longest word.
9. Construct following pattern using nested loop

10. Generate all factors of a number. 

Course Outcome 3(CO3):
1. Work with built-in packages
2. Create a package graphics with modules rectangle, circle and sub-package 3D-graphics with
modules cuboid and sphere. Include methods to find area and perimeter of respective figures
in each module. Write programs that finds area and perimeter of figures by different importing
statements. (Include selective import of modules and import * statements)

Course Outcome 5 (CO5):
 1. Write a Python program to read a file line by line and store it into a list.
2. Python program to copy odd lines of one file to other
3. Write a Python program to read each row from a given csv file and print a list of strings.
4. Write a Python program to read specific columns of a given CSV file and print the content
of the columns.
5. Write a Python program to write a Python dictionary to a csv file. After writing the CSV file
read the CSV file and display the content.
