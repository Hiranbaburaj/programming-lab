# 20MCA131: Programming Lab
Course Outcome 1 (CO1):
1. Accept the radius from user and find area of circle.
2. Check whether the given number is odd or even
3. Swap two variables
4. Count the occurrences of each word in a line of text.
5. Find the factorial of a given number
6. Display future leap years from current year to a final year entered by user.
7. Enter 2 lists of integers. Check (a) Whether list are of same length (b) whether list sums
to same value (c) whether any value occur in both
8. List comprehensions:
(a) Generate positive list of numbers from a given list of integers
(b) Square of N numbers
(c) Form a list of vowels selected from a given word
(d) List ordinal value of each element of a word (Hint: use ord() to get ordinal values)
9. Create a string from given string where first and last characters exchanged. [eg: python -
> nythop]
10. Prompt the user for a list of integers. For all values greater than 100, store ‘over’ instead.
11. Store a list of first names. Count the occurrences of ‘a’ within the list
12. Get a string from an input string where all occurrences of first character replaced with
‘$’, except first character.
[eg: onion -> oni$n]
13. Exchange first and last characters of a string
14. Find biggest of 3 numbers entered.
15. Accept a file name from user and print extension of that.
16. Create a list of colors from comma-separated color names entered by user. Display
 first and last colors.
17. Accept an integer n and compute n+nn+nnn.
18. Print out all colors from color-list1 not contained in color-list2.
19. Create a single string separated with space from two strings by swapping the
 character at position 1.
20. From a list of integers, create a list removing even numbers. 
21. Find gcd of 2 numbers.
22. Sort dictionary in ascending and descending order.
23. Merge two dictionaries.
